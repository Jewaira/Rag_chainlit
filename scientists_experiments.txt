Experiments of Famous Scientists

1.  Galileo Galilei - Inclined Plane Experiment Galileo rolled balls
    down inclined planes to study motion, demonstrating that objects
    accelerate uniformly under gravity.

2.  Isaac Newton - Prism Experiment Newton passed white light through a
    prism, showing that it splits into a spectrum of colors, proving
    light is made of many colors.

3.  Antoine Lavoisier - Combustion Experiment Lavoisier burned
    substances in closed containers, discovering that oxygen is required
    for combustion, laying foundations of modern chemistry.

4.  Michael Faraday - Electromagnetic Induction Faraday demonstrated
    that moving a magnet through a coil generates an electric current,
    leading to the principle of the electric generator.

5.  Gregor Mendel - Pea Plant Experiments Mendel cross-bred pea plants
    to discover the laws of inheritance, founding modern genetics.

6.  Marie Curie - Radioactivity Experiments Curie isolated radium and
    polonium, discovering properties of radioactivity that transformed
    physics and medicine.

7.  Albert Einstein - Photoelectric Effect Einstein explained that light
    consists of photons that can knock electrons off metal surfaces,
    helping establish quantum theory.

8.  James Watson & Francis Crick - DNA Structure Using X-ray diffraction
    data, Watson and Crick built a model of the DNA double helix,
    revealing the molecular basis of heredity.
